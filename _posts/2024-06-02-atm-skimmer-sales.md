Skimmers are devices that can be installed on or inside ATMs, POS terminals, or fuel pumps to be able to capture data directly entered by the users. Data could be PIIs and pincodes entries.

The data captured by the skimmers can now be used by criminals to create fake credit or debit cards to carry out illegal transactions, withdrwals and purchases from the affected victim's account.


## ATMs, POS Terminals, and Fuel Pump Skimmers
#### ATM Skimmers
ATM skimmers are used steal card details and PINs from unsuspecting users during ATM transactions. These devices are designed to capture data from the magnetic stripe of a credit or debit card, as well as the PIN entered by the cardholder. A typical ATM skimmer will have a card reader, camera, pin pad overlay and a transmitter. Some sophisticated skimmers might even include a Bluetooth or wireless transmitter that sends the captured data to the criminal without them having to retrieve the skimmer physically.

#### POS Skimmers
A POS skimmer is also a malicious device that attaches to or is embedded within a POS system to covertly capture card information during transactions.
These devices are typically used by criminals to steal credit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes, which are then used for fraudulent activities.
