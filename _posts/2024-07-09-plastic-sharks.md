Stolen cards refer to compromised card data, not the physical cards themselves. These compromised cards and PayPal accounts often have balances but are sold at a discounted price to enable the buyer to turn a profit.

PlasticSharks provide access to this compromised data by cloning the stolen information onto new physical cards, which are then shipped to the buyer after purchase. These sites also sell PayPal account credentials, providing the login information once payment is received via their Bitcoin wallet.


## How does PlasticSharks get stolen cards and PayPal credentials?

This is the use of an electronic device to copy and store credit card information which can be loaded to new cards and sold out.

**Phishing:**

The user is then provided with a tracking number that is used to track order.

## Rounding up
The sale of compromised cards and credentials constitutes a financial crime in numerous countries globally. This is why the dark web and cryptocurrency have provided a level of anonymity, allowing these illegal activities to persist and flourish. 

Individuals are urged to remain vigilant to avoid falling victim to skimming and phishing, which could lead to their data being sold on the dark web.
