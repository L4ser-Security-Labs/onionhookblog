Steroids are a class of synthetic compounds that mimic the effects of hormones produced naturally in the human body. They can be classified into two main categories: Corticosteroids and Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids (AAS). While corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and treat various medical conditions, anabolic-androgenic steroids are often associated with muscle growth and performance enhancement.


## Why Steroids Are Considered Illegal and Dangerous
Steroids, particularly anabolic-androgenic steroids, are considered illegal without a prescription in many countries due to their potential for abuse and serious health risks. They are mostly classified as controlled substances to prevent misuse and protect public health.

Some health risks associated with the use of steroids include:

- Addiction and prolonged use of steroids can lead to dependency, where individuals continue to use them despite experiencing negative health effects.
- Oral steroids can cause liver toxicity and increase the risk of liver cancer.
- Steroid use can lead to high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes.
- Steroids can disrupt the body's natural hormone production, leading to conditions like gynecomastia (breast development in men) and infertility.
- Acne, hair loss, and masculinization in women (e.g., deepening of the voice, increased body hair).
- Users may experience mood swings, aggression (often referred to as "roid rage"), depression, and anxiety.


## Laws governing the use and distribution of Steriods in the UK and USA
In the United Kingdom, steriods are classified as "Class C Drugs", meaning that they fall under the category of controlled drugs under the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 that are seen to be the least harmful of substances to people, but still attract long prison sentences if found guilty in court, even for possession. It is legal to possess steroids for personal use with a prescription, but illegal to posses, supply or produce them without a prescription. Penalties for possesion without a prescription is up to 2 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both while penalty for supplying can include up to 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine.

In the United States of America, setriod are classified as "Schedule III (3)" drugs, meaning that they fall under the categorty of drugs that may cause physical dependence but more commonly lead to psychological dependence despite having a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
The federal penalty for the manufacture, distribution, or sale of Schedule III drugs of any quantity not more than five years' imprisonment and/or a $250,000.00 fine for a first offense; penalty is doubled for a second offense.

Products offered for sale include:
- **MCT (Medium-Chain Triglycerides):** used as a carrier oil in the formulation of injectable steroids. They help in the smooth administration of the steroid into the muscle tissue. 
- **Grape Seed Oil:** is another common carrier oil for injectable steroids. It is chosen for its thin consistency, which makes injections less painful and reduces the risk of injection site abscesses.
- **Oral Steroids:** Oral steroids are taken by mouth in pill or liquid form. They are convenient and easy to administer compared to injectable forms. Common examples are Methandrostenolone (Dianabol), Oxandrolone (Anavar), Stanozolol (Winstrol).
- **HGH (Human Growth Hormone) / HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin):**  HGH is used to promote muscle growth, increase strength, and enhance recovery. It is not a steroid but is often used alongside steroids to amplify performance enhancement, while HCG is often used during or after steroid cycles to stimulate natural testosterone production. It mimics the luteinizing hormone (LH) that triggers testosterone production in the testes.

## Red Flags
While the shop offers several features to make customers and potential customers feel safe such as tracking service for packages once orders are made, anonymous payments, and free worldwide shipping, there are several red flags that we've identified.

- **Too-Good-To-Be-True Prices:** The promotion claims that buying these high-value handbags guarantees a profit, suggesting they can be sold for more than their purchase price. This is a common tactic used to lure buyers into a false sense of security.

- **Anonymous and Untraceable Payment Methods:** The insistence on payment through Bitcoin or Monero is concerning. These cryptocurrencies are often favoured for their anonymity, which can make it difficult to trace transactions if something goes wrong.

- **Claims of Unlimited Stock:** Legitimate sellers, especially those dealing in luxury goods, typically do not have an unlimited stock of high-demand items like Chanel bags. This claim is unrealistic and should raise suspicion.

- **Exclusively Online Sales:** The explanation that they sell only through their website and not in bulk to shops for risk reasons is dubious. Reputable businesses do not operate under such constraints and usually have clear, verifiable distribution channels.

- **Suspicious Contact Information:** The contact email provided (GlobalDeepWeb[@]proton[.]me) uses a service known for its use in maintaining anonymity. This, combined with the context, suggests an effort to avoid traceability.
