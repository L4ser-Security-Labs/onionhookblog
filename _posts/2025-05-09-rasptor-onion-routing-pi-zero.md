**Rasptor** is a lightweight tool that forces all traffic from a Raspberry Pi device through the Tor network. With a single command, Rasptor transparently routes all outgoing traffic ‚Äî including DNS ‚Äî through Tor‚Äôs anonymity layer.

It‚Äôs designed for researchers, activists, hackers, and tinkerers who want **anonymity at the network level**, especially on compact Linux-based systems like the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.


### Why Rasptor?
The Raspberry Pi is a tiny powerhouse. But like any internet-connected device, it leaks data ‚Äî through DNS requests, app-level calls, telemetry, and more. Even if you're using Tor Browser, many background services still talk directly to the internet.

**Rasptor solves this** by:
- Routing **all traffic** ‚Äî not just browser traffic ‚Äî through Tor  
- Ensuring **DNS requests** go through Tor‚Äôs DNSPort  
- Automatically handling **iptables rules**  
- Providing **one-liner control** with easy enable/disable/toggle  
- Rolling back cleanly if anything breaks  

It‚Äôs like turning your Pi into a stealthy ghost node üëª.


### Features
- Transparent Tor routing  
- DNS leak protection  
- Clean iptables setup and teardown  
- Auto Tor configuration and backup  
- Toggle between normal and Tor modes  
- Logging (start, end, uptime, actions)  
- Root permission check  
- Installable as a package with `rasptor` command  
- Reversible with zero system damage  


### Use Cases
- OSINT and threat intel collection (with better OPSEC)  
- Secure browsing from Pi kiosks  
- IoT deployments in adversarial environments  
- Personal anonymity projects  
- Educational labs for anonymity tools  


### How It Works (Under the Hood)
When you run `rasptor`:

1. It configures `/etc/tor/torrc` with:
    ```sh
    VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 10.192.0.0/10
    AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
    TransPort 9040
    DNSPort 5353
    ```
2. It flushes and sets iptables rules:
    - Routes all TCP SYN packets to Tor‚Äôs TransPort (9040)  
    - Redirects all UDP DNS to Tor‚Äôs DNSPort (5353)  
    - Skips Tor‚Äôs own traffic and localhost  
3. It saves these rules via `netfilter-persistent`  
4. It runs `systemctl restart tor`  
5. It checks connectivity by hitting `https://check.torproject.org` via `curl`  

If anything goes wrong, you can roll back to normal mode.

### üöÄ Getting Started
Make sure you have tor and iptables installed:
``` sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor iptables -y
```

Download the latest binary from the Release page and the run:
```sudo dpkg -i rasptor_1.0_all.deb```

Or download and install from Cloudsmith:

``` sh
wget https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/l4ser-security-labs/rasptor/deb/any-distro/pool/any-version/main/r/ra/rasptor_1.0/rasptor_1.0_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i rasptor_1.0_all.deb
```

## üöÄ Usage
To enable Tor routing, run:
```sh
sudo rasptor
```

You‚Äôll see a menu like:

```
=============================
       Rasptor Control
=============================
1) Enable Tor routing
2) Disable Tor routing
3) Toggle Tor routing
4) Exit
=============================
Choose an option [1-4]:
```

then select Enable Tor routing.

Disable Tor routing:
```sh
sudo rasptor
```
then select Disable Tor routing.
This restores default iptables rules and restarts your network stack.


Toggle routing (automatically switches based on Tor state):
```sh
sudo rasptor
```
then select Toggle Tor routing

## ‚ùå Uninstallation
```sudo dpkg -r rasptor```

## üß™ Build from Source
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/l4sersec/rasptor.git
dpkg-deb --build rasptor
```

### üìä Logs & Auditing
Rasptor logs every execution to `/var/log/rasptor/rasptor.log`, including:

- Start time  
- End time  
- Total uptime of Rasptor session  
- Action taken (enabled/disabled)  
- User that invoked the script  
- Output of Tor status and curl check  


### üåê Verifying You‚Äôre Using Tor
Once enabled, Rasptor runs:

```bash
curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org
```

You should see:

```
[‚úì] Success: System is routing traffic through Tor!
```

(Note: System-wide `curl` is used ‚Äî not the browser.)


### üó£Ô∏è Final Thoughts
Rasptor is built for the curious ‚Äî those who want to explore how anonymity works at a low level, beyond the browser.

It‚Äôs not a magic bullet. You still need:

- Strong endpoint hygiene  
- No personal info leaking via apps  
- No browser fingerprinting  

But as a low-cost, high-impact anonymity layer for your Pi, Rasptor is a great start.

Pull requests, forks, and feedback welcome.
